# RecruitU: Career Path Visualization Tool

### Purpose

RecruitU is a platform designed to empower individuals in competitive fields like finance and quantitative research by providing clarity and actionable insights into career trajectories. The tool allows users to analyze how others have successfully navigated to top firms, helping them identify the steps they need to take to reach their own career goals.

### Inspiration

Many individuals approach career planning by selecting their desired firm or position and working backward to determine the key steps required. For example:

- Apollo in private equity may frequently recruit from PJTâ€™s restructuring group.
- Quantitative research firms like HRT might favor candidates with data science internships at top tech companies.

These patterns, while critical, are often inaccessible or difficult to interpret. RecruitU bridges this gap by offering a data-driven platform that visualizes career paths, enabling users to make informed decisions about their next steps.

### Value Proposition

RecruitU simplifies career planning by making career trajectories accessible and actionable. By focusing on clear and reliable insights, it provides users with the guidance they need to confidently pursue their professional goals.
